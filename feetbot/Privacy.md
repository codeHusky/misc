feetbot temporarily stores user inputs for use in some “witty” responses by the bot. However, only messages that directly and intentionally interface with the bot will have their inputs stored. All other information, such as messages that trigger the “feet” feature, are not stored and are simply processed.

feetbot does not store any user input information permanently - it is only stored in-memory and resets when the bot is restarted. All data is processed anonymously.
